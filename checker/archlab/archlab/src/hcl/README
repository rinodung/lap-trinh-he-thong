This directory contains files to generate the HCL code for three processors:
SEQ, SEQ+, and PIPE.

The different versions of the HCL files are extracted from two
different master files: master-pipe.hcl and master-seq.hcl.  The Perl
script vextract.pl does the extraction.

The different HCL files are as follows:

seq-std.hcl		Standard version of SEQ
seq-std-annotate.hcl    Standard version + annotations for code extraction
seq-nocmov-annotate.hcl	Version without conditional moves implemented
seq-full.hcl		Assignment to implement iaddq instruction
seq-full-ans.hcl	Implements iaddq instruction
seq+-std.hcl		Standard version of SEQ+
seq+-std-annotate.hcl	Standard version of SEQ+ with annotations

pipe-std.hcl		Standard version of PIPE
pipe-std-annotate.hcl	PIPE with annotations for code extraction
pipe-full.hcl		Assignment to implement iaddq
pipe-full-ans.hcl	Solution with iaddq
pipe-lf.hcl		Assignment to implement load forwarding
pipe-lf-ans.hcl		Solution with load forwarding
pipe-nobypass.hcl	Assignment to implement PIPE-
pipe-nobypass-annotate.hcl	Assignment with annotations
pipe-nobypass-ans.hcl	Solution to implement PIPE- 
pipe-nt.hcl		Assignment to implement NT branch pred.
pipe-nt-ans.hcl		Solution to implement NT branch.
pipe-btfnt.hcl		Assignment to implement BTFNT branch pred.
pipe-btfnt-ans.hcl	Solution to implement BTFNT branch pred.
pipe-1w.hcl		Assignment to implement single write port
pipe-1w-annotate.hcl	Assignment to implement single write port with ann.
pipe-1w-ans.hcl		Solution to implement single write port
