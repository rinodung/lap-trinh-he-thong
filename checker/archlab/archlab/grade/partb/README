This directory contains autograding scripts for Part B of the CS:APP
Architecture Lab.

********
1. Files
********

config.pm
	Config file for grade-handins.pl and grade-archlabb.pl

grade-archlabb.pl
	The autograder. Runs and evaluates the seq-full.hcl
	for correct implementation of the iaddq and leave instructions.


grade-handins.pl
	A driver that invokes the autograder on every handin
	file in the handin directory.

handin/
	The handin directory

handin.grades/
	Generated grade reports

printdir.pl
	A handy script that calls enscript on each file in a directory.

You can see a summary of the command line arguments for each script by
running them with the -h argument.

2. Configuring the autograders
##############################

The config.pm file contains all of the configuration info for the
grading scripts. It defines defaults that can be overridden on the
command lines. In general, you won't need to change anything in
config.pm.


**********************************************
3. How to use the grade-archlabb.pl autograder
**********************************************

Collect all of the student handin files in the ./handin directory. To
grade a single handin file (say ./handin/ac00-1-seq-full.hcl) type:

	unix> ./grade-archlabb.pl -f handin/ac00-1-seq-full.hcl

You can override the default location of the Y86-64 tools in config.pm
using the -s <codedir> option.  You can also use the -e flag to
control whether you want the student's handin source file included in
the grading sheet.

If you have a small class, you can run grade-archlabb.pl manually on
each handin file. If you have a bigger class, you'll want to use the
grade-handins.pl driver, which will invoke grade-archlabb.pl on each
handin file automatically.


*****************************************
4. How to use the grade-handins.pl driver
*****************************************

To grade all of the handin files in the ./handin directory, type:

	unix> ./grade-handins.pl

By default, this calls the grade-archlabb.pl autograder for each handin
file in directory ./handin, and redirects the resulting grade reports
to files in the ./handin.grades directory. You can override these
with the -s and -d command line options.

Use the -e flag if you don't want the student's handin file included
in the output grade sheet.

You can expect that some handins will have problems, such as the code
won't compile, or their program dumps core. In these cases, the driver
flags the problem, and goes on to the next handin file.

You can print compact hardcopies of the grade reports using enscript:

	unix> enscript -P<your printer> -2r ./handin.grades/*.out

If you have two-sided printers and want to start each student's
submission on a new page, you can use the handy printdir.pl script.

	unix> (cd handin.grades; ../printdir.pl -P<your printer>)
