This directory contains autograding scripts for Part A of the the
CS:APP Architecture Lab. The scripts compile and run each student
submission and display the outputs of each in a grade report.

1. Files
********

config.pm
        Config file for grade-mhandins.pl and grade-archlaba.pl

grade-archlaba.pl
        The Arch Lab Part A autograder. Compiles and runs three
        .ys handin files and emits a report on standard output.

grade-mhandins.pl
        A driver that invokes the autograder on every set of handin
        files in the handin/ directory and emits a report for each
        student in the handin.grades/ directory.

handin/ 
        The handin directory. Contains handins from two users: one
        correct (ans-*) and one incorrect (err-*).

handin.grades/
        Output grade reports for each set of handins in handin/

printdir.pl
        A handy script that calls enscript on each file in a directory.

You can see a summary of the command line arguments for each script by
running them with the -h argument.

2. Configuring the autograders
##############################

The config.pm file contains all of the configuration info for the
grading scripts. It defines defaults that can be overridden on the
command lines. In general, you won't need to change anything in
config.pm.


**********************************************
3. How to use the grade-archlaba.pl autograder
**********************************************

Collect the handin files for each student and give each file a unique
prefix (e.g., userid-sum.ys, userid-rsum.ys, userid-copy.ys).

To grade a single student's handins, type

   unix> ./grade-archlaba.pl -f handin/userid

where userid is the unique prefix for that student. 

You can override the default location of the Y86-64 tools in config.pm
using the -s <codedir> option.  You can also use the -e flag to
control whether you want the student's handin source file included in
the grading sheet.

If you have a small class, you can run grade-archlaba.pl manually on
each student. If you have a bigger class, you'll want to use the
grade-mhandins.pl driver, which will invoke grade-archlaba.pl on each
set of handin files automatically.


******************************************
4. How to use the grade-mhandins.pl driver
******************************************

To grade all of the handin files in the ./handin directory, type:

   unix> ./grade-mhandins.pl

By default, this calls the grade-archlaba.pl autograder for each unique
prefix in the directory ./handin, and redirects the resulting grade reports
to files in the ./handin.grades directory. You can override these
with the -s and -d command line options.

Use the -e flag if you don't want the student's handin file included
in the output grade sheet.

You can expect that some handins will have problems, such as the code
won't compile, or their program dumps core. In these cases, the driver
flags the problem, and goes on to the next handin file.

You can print compact hardcopies of the grade reports using enscript:

    unix> enscript -P<your printer> -2r ./handin.grades/*.out

If you have two-sided printers and want to start each student's
submission on a new page, you can use the printdir.pl script.

    unix> (cd handin.grades; ../printdir.pl -P<your printer>)
