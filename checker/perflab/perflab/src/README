driver.c
	Tests performance of all versions of the rotate and smooth kernels
	The command line arguments are summarized by the "-h" flag
	and also explained in more detail in the lab writeup.
	NOTE: There is a hidden "-t" flag that skips the checking
	of the team struct. This is handy when you are testing out
	the kernels-naive.c file that is handed out to students.

kernels.c 
	This file is linked into the driver program. It contains
	versions of the rotate and smooth kernels. The file is actually 
	a soft links to either	kernels-naive.c or kernels-solution.c.
	Type "make naive" to soft link to the naive versions. Type
	"make solution" to soft link to the solutions.

config.h
	Contains all the site-specific information you need to modify 
	in order to run	driver.c at your site. 

kernels-naive.c
	The baseline versions of rotate and smooth that are handed
	out to the students and which they modify.

kernels-solution.c
	Some solutions to rotate and smooth that give the instructor
	a sense of the range of speedups.

clock.{c,h}
fcyc.{c,h}
	Timing routines that implement the k-best measurement 
	scheme (Chapter 9) using IA32 cycle counters.

Makefile-handout
README-handout
	The Makefile and README that are handed out to the students.
