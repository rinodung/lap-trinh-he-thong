######################################################################

This directory contains autograding scripts for the CS:APP Cache Lab.

Each time a student with login "foo" compiles their work, the Makefile
automatically generates a handin file called foo-handin.tar. 

If you want to use the autograding scripts in this directory, then you
should first collect all of these student handin tar files into the
./handin directory.


********
1. Files
********
config.pm
	Config file for grade-handins.pl and grade-cachelab.pl

grade-cachelab.pl
	The Cache Lab autograder. Grades a single foo-handin.tar handin
	file for user foo and emits a report on standard output.

grade-handins.pl
	A driver that invokes the autograder on every handin tar file
	in the handin directory.  

handin/ 
        The handin directory

printdir.pl 
        Handy script that calls enscript on each file in a directory.

You can see a summary of the command line arguments for each script by
running them with the -h argument.

2. Configuring the autograders
##############################

The config.pm file contains all of the configuration info for the
grading scripts. It defines defaults that can be overridden on the
command lines. In general, you won't need to change anything in
config.pm, unless you change the location of the driver source files,
the location of the student handins, or the max points for the assignment.

*********************************************
1. How to use the grade-cachelab.pl autograder
*********************************************

Collect all of the student handin files in the ./handin directory. To
grade a single handin file (say ./handin/droh-handin.tar) type:

	unix> ./grade-cachelab.pl -f handin/droh-handin.tar

By default, this looks for the test code in ../src. You can override
this with the -s <srcdir> option.  You can also use the -e flag to
control whether you want the student's handin source files included in
the grading sheet.

If you have a small class, you can run grade-cachelab.pl manually on
each handin file. If you have a bigger class, you'll want to use the
grade-handins.pl programs, which will invoke grade-cachelab.pl on each
handin file automatically.

*****************************************
2. How to use the grade-handins.pl driver
*****************************************

To grade all of the handin files in the ./handin directory, type:

	unix> ./grade-handins.pl

By default, this calls the grade-cachelab.pl autograder for each handin
file in directory ./handin, and redirects the resulting grade reports
to files in the ./handin.grades directory. You can override these
with the -s and -d command line options.

Use the -e flag if you don't want the student's handin file included
in the output grade sheet.

You can expect that some handins will have problems, either because
the students forgot to enter their team information, or their code
won't compile, or their program dumps core. In these cases, the driver
flags the problem, and goes on to the next handin file.

You can print compact hardcopies of the grade reports using enscript:

	unix> enscript -P<your printer> -2r ./handin.grades/*.out

If you have two-sided printers and want to start each student's
submission on a new page, you can use the handy printdir.pl script.
