Files used to solve attack targets for attack lab

SEQUENCE:

Generating the exploits for a target involve a number of steps
(performed by buildtarget.pl in build directory):

1. Use readd.pl to find addresses of functions touch1, touch2, and
   touch3 from rtarget and ctarget, as well as the byte code for the
   gadget farm in rtarget.
2. Use harvest to find gadgets in the gadget farm for rtarget
2. Use addresses.pl to find stack offset and stack pointer for getbuf
3. Use solve-all.pl to generate exploit strings.  Solve-all.pl calls
   solver.pl, which, in turn, calls programs readd.pl and exploit

FILES:

    harvest.c

Find gadgets from byte stream generated by readd.pl from gadget farm in rtarget

    exploit.c

Generate ROP exploits for specified phase

    addresses.pl

Run GDB to determine stack address and offset in getbuf()

    readd.pl

Extract useful things from disassembled code.

    solver.pl

Generate solution for single phase

    solve-all.pl

Generate solutions for all phases
